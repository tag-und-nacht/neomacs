# Building NEO Emacs from Source

Prebuilt binaries for Linux, macOS, and Windows are available on the
[releases page](https://github.com/eval-exec/neomacs/releases) — building from source
is only needed for development or unsupported platforms.

## Prerequisites

- **Rust** (stable, pinned via `rust-toolchain.toml` — rustup installs it automatically)
- **GStreamer** (optional, for video playback)
- **WPE WebKit** (optional, for the inline browser on Linux)
- **WebKit.framework** (macOS: the inline browser uses the system
  `WKWebView`; nothing to install)
- **VA-API** (optional, for hardware video decode on Linux)
- **GNU Emacs** (optional, for pre-compiling .el files — speeds up bootstrap ~17x)
- **SQLite** is built into Neomacs from the version bundled by `rusqlite`; no
  system SQLite package or runtime library is required

Build commands in this document are run from the repository root.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Optional (recommended): use the repo dev shell (handles all dependencies)
nix develop --accept-flake-config

# Build NEO Emacs (compiles Rust, bootstraps Elisp, generates pdump)
cargo xtask fresh-build --release

# On memory-constrained machines (including 8 GiB WSL guests), serialize the
# Cargo compilation stages. This trades build time for a lower peak RSS.
cargo xtask fresh-build --release --low-memory

# Run
./target/release/neomacs
```

## Testing

After a release fresh build, run the main parity suites with:

```bash
cargo nextest run -p neovm-core --no-fail-fast
cargo nextest run -p neovm-oracle-tests --no-fail-fast
cargo nextest run -p neomacs-tui-tests --release --no-fail-fast
```

The TUI harness uses `target/release/neomacs` by default, regardless of the
Cargo test profile. Set `NEOMACS_TUI_NEOMACS_BIN` to use a different binary.

Set `NEOMACS_TUI_RECORD=on` to write an asciicast v3 recording for every
`TuiSession`. Recording is disabled by default. Core parity tests are grouped
by Rust test name and package parity tests by package scenario:

```text
target/tui-recordings/
├── neomacs-tui-tests/<test-name>/{gnu,neomacs}.cast
└── neomacs-melpa-tests/<scenario>/{gnu,neomacs}.cast
```

Replay a recording with `asciinema play <path>`. Set
`NEOMACS_TUI_RECORD_DIR=<path>` to select another artifact root. A relative
artifact root is resolved from the Cargo workspace. CI explicitly enables
recording for TUI jobs and uploads the resulting casts.

Other distributions should follow similar dependency installation with their
package manager.

## macOS (Experimental)

macOS support is experimental — see
[issue #22](https://github.com/eval-exec/neomacs/issues/22) for status.

### The inline browser (xwidgets)

`xwidget-internal` is provided on macOS, through the system `WKWebView` rather
than WPE: `WKWebView` has no offscreen render path, so the view is a native
`NSView` placed over the GPU surface rather than a texture composited into it.
This is what GNU Emacs does on macOS (`src/nsxwidget.m`), and the placement
algorithm is ported from `src/xwidget.c`.  The adapter lives in
`crates/neomacs-webview/src/platform/macos` and is compiled by the `webview`
Cargo feature, which the darwin production capability row in `Cargo.toml`
requests, so `cargo xtask fresh-build --release` and the Nix package ship it.
`xwidget-internal` is advertised only when that backend is compiled in.

What works, as of the follow-ups to
[issue #300](https://github.com/eval-exec/neomacs/issues/300):

- `xwidget-webkit-browse-url` in any top-level frame: creation, navigation,
  placement, clipping, hiding, resize, and a view moving between frames.
- Measured load progress: `xwidget-webkit-estimated-load-progress` follows
  `WKWebView`'s `estimatedProgress` through key-value observing, and the
  `WKNavigationDelegate` reports the GNU load phases, delivered to Lisp as
  `(xwidget-event load-changed XWIDGET "load-started" | "load-redirected" |
  "load-committed" | "load-finished")`, exactly what `xwidget-webkit-callback`
  in `lisp/xwidget.el` keys its progress timer and buffer title on.
- Script results: `xwidget-webkit-execute-script` delivers its optional `FUN`
  the JSON-converted result asynchronously, so `xwidget-webkit-get-selection`
  and `xwidget-webkit-insert-string` work.  As in GNU, `FUN` is not called when
  the script throws.
- Keyboard focus, following `src/nsxwidget.m`: a key that reaches the web view
  stays with Emacs unless the page reports an input element (INPUT or
  TEXTAREA) focused, and `C-g` typed into such an element hands focus back to
  Emacs without being relayed.  Mouse input goes through the responder chain.

Known gaps:

- GNU's `isearch-mode` special case (keys always go to Emacs while searching)
  reads a buffer-local Lisp variable from the AppKit thread; the render thread
  cannot ask Lisp synchronously, so while isearch is active a page input keeps
  the keys.
- Persistent browser profiles are isolated by the OS only on macOS 14 and
  later; older systems fall back to WebKit's process-wide store.

Two more limits come from the overlay technique itself, and GNU Emacs has
shipped with all of them for years: Neomacs UI cannot paint over the web view
(mode line, minibuffer, popups, cursor), and scrolling it lags the
GPU-composited content by about a frame. One further limit GNU shares: a single
web view can be shown in only one window at a time.

Maintainers should use the reproducible signing, notarization, and artifact
verification flow in [releasing-macos.md](releasing-macos.md) rather than
uploading a locally assembled app bundle.

```bash
# Install dependencies (Homebrew)
brew install pkgconf \
  glib cairo \
  gstreamer gst-plugins-base gst-plugins-good \
  jpeg-turbo libtiff giflib libpng librsvg webp \
  gnutls libxml2 jansson tree-sitter gmp

# gmp-mpfr-sys is built with system GMP support. Its build script probes
# GMP with the C compiler directly, so Homebrew's keg must be visible to
# both the C compiler and linker.
export CPATH="$(brew --prefix gmp)/include${CPATH:+:$CPATH}"
export LIBRARY_PATH="$(brew --prefix gmp)/lib${LIBRARY_PATH:+:$LIBRARY_PATH}"

# Install Rust (if not already installed)
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# Build NEO Emacs
cargo xtask fresh-build --release

# Run
./target/release/neomacs
```

## NixOS / Nix

The development shell provides WPE WebKit through
[nix-wpe-webkit](https://github.com/eval-exec/nix-wpe-webkit), so opt-in
`webview` builds do not compile WebKit locally. The default production package
currently enables Linux video but not `webview`; this policy lives in
`Cargo.toml` and is consumed by both `xtask` and `flake.nix`.

The `flake.nix` includes `nixConfig` for the Cachix cache. Pass
`--accept-flake-config` to use it automatically, or configure it system-wide:

**NixOS** — add to your configuration (e.g., `/etc/nixos/configuration.nix`):

```nix
{
  nix.settings.substituters = [ "https://nix-wpe-webkit.cachix.org" ];
  nix.settings.trusted-public-keys = [ "nix-wpe-webkit.cachix.org-1:ItCjHkz1Y5QcwqI9cTGNWHzcox4EqcXqKvOygxpwYHE=" ];
}
```

**Non-NixOS** — add to `~/.config/nix/nix.conf`:

```
extra-substituters = https://nix-wpe-webkit.cachix.org
extra-trusted-public-keys = nix-wpe-webkit.cachix.org-1:ItCjHkz1Y5QcwqI9cTGNWHzcox4EqcXqKvOygxpwYHE=
```

### Build with Nix

**Option 1** — Trust the `nixConfig` in `flake.nix` (simplest):

```bash
nix build --accept-flake-config

# Or enter development shell
nix develop --accept-flake-config
```

Validate all advertised package/app/dev-shell outputs without building the
large package:

```bash
nix flake check --all-systems --no-build --accept-flake-config \
  --option allow-import-from-derivation false
```

Run the installed-package and Home Manager startup contracts on native Linux:

```bash
nix build --accept-flake-config \
  .#checks.x86_64-linux.installed-package-contract \
  .#checks.x86_64-linux.home-manager-contract
```

Both startup checks use a clean temporary home and deliberately do not pass
`--quick`, `-Q`, or `--no-site-file`.

### Home Manager

Select the package from the Neomacs flake explicitly instead of relying on an
unrelated ambient `pkgs.neomacs` attribute:

```nix
{
  programs.emacs = {
    enable = true;
    package = inputs.neomacs.packages.${pkgs.system}.default;
  };
}
```

The package provides `emacs`/`emacsclient` compatibility names alongside
`neomacs`/`neomacsclient`, so Home Manager's Emacs wrapper can use the same
installed runtime and portable dump.

**Option 2** — Pass Cachix flags directly:

```bash
nix build \
  --extra-substituters "https://nix-wpe-webkit.cachix.org" \
  --extra-trusted-public-keys "nix-wpe-webkit.cachix.org-1:ItCjHkz1Y5QcwqI9cTGNWHzcox4EqcXqKvOygxpwYHE="
```

> **Note:** Both options require your user to be in `trusted-users` in
> `/etc/nix/nix.conf` (e.g., `trusted-users = root @wheel your-username`), or
> configure the cache system-wide as shown above.

### Manual build (inside dev shell)

```bash
cargo xtask fresh-build --release

# Lower-memory alternative; equivalent to passing --jobs 1 to every Cargo
# compilation owned by the fresh-build pipeline.
cargo xtask fresh-build --release --low-memory
```
