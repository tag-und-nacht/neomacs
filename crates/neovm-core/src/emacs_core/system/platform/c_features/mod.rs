//! Every feature GNU's C `Fprovide`s, and what decides it here.
//!
//! # Why this is a table and not a `vec!` of names
//!
//! In GNU, a C-level feature is not a name someone chose to list.  It is a
//! *consequence*: `configure` sets a preprocessor symbol, the `#ifdef` compiles
//! (or does not compile) the `syms_of_*` that contains the `Fprovide`, and the
//! same `#ifdef` compiles the implementation the feature advertises.  One
//! switch decides both, so GNU cannot advertise a capability it did not build.
//!
//! This port had the two halves separated: the implementations lived behind
//! real conditions -- `cfg(neomacs_have_lcms2)` from a `build.rs` `pkg-config`
//! probe, `notify`-crate watches, real OS threads -- while the advertisement
//! was a hand-written `vec!["threads", "dbusbind", "inotify"]`.  Ledger 192
//! measured the result: **`dbusbind` was advertised with no D-Bus transport
//! behind it at all**, and GNU's own Lisp uses `(featurep 'dbusbind)` as *the*
//! build test (`lisp/net/tramp-gvfs.el:123`, `lisp/net/tramp-archive.el:124`,
//! `lisp/net/dbus.el` at seven sites, `lisp/net/secrets.el:793`,
//! `lisp/system-sleep.el:208`, `lisp/system-taskbar.el:224`,
//! `lisp/gnus/gnus-dbus.el:45`, `lisp/ps-samp.el:258`).
//!
//! So the list is derived from the table below, in which every row states what
//! decides the feature in GNU **and** what backs it here.  A row cannot be
//! provided without naming an implementation, because [`HereDecision`] has no
//! variant that says yes without one.  That is the compile-time half of the
//! rule; `c_features_test.rs` is the run-time half.
//!
//! # The order is GNU's, and it is observable
//!
//! `features` is built by consing (`src/fns.c:3751`), so the list reads
//! newest-provided first, and the order is a fact about `main`'s `syms_of_*`
//! sequence in `src/emacs.c`.  [`gnu_c_features`] is written in that observed
//! order -- `syms_of_threads` (`emacs.c:2490`) is last to provide and first in
//! the list, `Vfeatures = list1 (Qemacs)` (`src/fns.c:6820`) is the seed and
//! last in the list -- so filtering it preserves GNU's relative order for free.
//!
